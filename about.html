        <center><h2> About MAN</h2></center>
        <p>We are a professional organization of mathematicians in Nepal that aims to promote and advance the study of mathematics in the country. Established in 1979, MAN has been a vital force in fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among mathematicians. Our association provides support and resources to students and educators in Nepal, helping to nurture a new generation of mathematicians and researchers. One of the ways we accomplish our goals is by organizing mathematical seminars and conferences. These events provide a platform for mathematicians to share their research, insights and ideas, and encourage students to explore new mathematical concepts.</p>
